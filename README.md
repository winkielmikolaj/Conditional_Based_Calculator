# Conditional Based Calculator

A simple console-based calculator application written in C#. This application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division (with validation for division by zero)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred C# IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
3. Build and run the project.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

## How It Works

1. The program displays a menu with options for different arithmetic operations.
2. The user selects an operation by typing the corresponding symbol (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
4. The chosen arithmetic operation is performed on the input numbers.
5. The result is displayed to the user.
6. The program validates the division operation to ensure that neither number is zero to avoid division by zero errors.
